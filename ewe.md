# Intro to OSHA

The **Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)** is an agency under the U.S. Department of Labor, created through the **Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) of 1970**. Before OSHA existed, there were no national laws that specifically protected workers from safety and health hazards. Its mission is clear: **to save lives, prevent injuries, and protect the health of America’s workers** by ensuring safe and healthy workplace conditions.  

OSHA covers a wide range of industries, such as **manufacturing, construction, agriculture, medicine, longshoring, disaster relief**, and even religious organizations when they employ workers for non-religious purposes.  

To achieve its mission, OSHA:  
- Develops and enforces job safety and health standards.  
- Conducts worksite inspections.  
- Requires employers to maintain injury and illness records.  
- Provides training programs to improve knowledge of occupational safety and health.  
- Supports state-run occupational safety programs.  

### Employer Responsibilities  
Employers are legally obligated to provide a safe workplace. If no specific standards exist, they must still comply with the **General Duty Clause**, which requires workplaces to be free of recognized hazards. Employers must:  
- Establish safety policies and administrative controls.  
- Use **engineering controls** to reduce risks.  
- Provide **personal protective equipment (PPE)** when hazards cannot be fully eliminated.  
- Pay for most required PPE and train employees on its correct use.  
- Report fatalities within **8 hours** and serious incidents (hospitalization, amputation, or eye loss) within **24 hours**.  
- Keep accurate records of injuries and illnesses.  

### Worker Rights  
Workers have key rights under OSHA, including:  
- The right to a **safe and healthy workplace**.  
- The right to **know about workplace hazards and chemicals**.  
- The right to **training and information**.  
- The right to **access injury and illness records**.  
- The right to **file complaints** with OSHA and participate in inspections.  
- Protection against **retaliation** for reporting unsafe conditions.  

### OSHA Inspections  
Inspections are a major enforcement tool and follow four stages:  
1. Presenting credentials.  
2. Opening conference.  
3. Walk-around inspection.  
4. Closing conference.  

If violations are found, OSHA issues **citations and penalties** depending on the severity. Employers and workers both have rights to contest aspects of citations, though workers cannot dispute the penalties directly.  

### Resources  
Safety information can be accessed both inside and outside the workplace:  
- **Inside**: Labels, warning signs, Safety Data Sheets (SDSs), training manuals, and procedures.  
- **Outside**: OSHA’s official website (www.osha.gov), healthcare professionals, and libraries with safety and health resources.

### Conclusion  
OSHA plays a vital role in protecting workers across the United States by setting and enforcing standards, requiring employer compliance, and ensuring workers understand their rights. While OSHA provides regulations and oversight, achieving a truly safe workplace depends on **cooperation between employers and employees** in identifying and reducing hazards.

# Top 6 Workplace Hazards Identified  

Hazards exist in every workplace, but some have greater potential to cause harm. By identifying hazards, organizations can take steps to control or eliminate them, preventing accidents, injuries, illnesses, property damage, and downtime. A thorough hazard assessment is an essential part of any safety program. A hazard is defined as **any source of potential damage, harm, or adverse health effects** to workers, property, or the environment. Hazards can be grouped into six main categories: biological, physical, ergonomic, chemical, psychological, and safety hazards.  

### 1. Biological Hazards  
Biological hazards include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms that can harm health. Examples include blood and body fluids, mold, insect bites, poisonous plants, animal and bird droppings, and pathogens like tuberculosis-causing bacteria. Protective clothing, respiratory equipment, and proper hygiene practices such as thorough washing can reduce the risks of exposure.  

### 2. Physical Hazards  
Physical hazards are not always visible but can be very dangerous. They include radiation, extreme temperatures, loud noises, poor lighting, and exposure to sun or ultraviolet rays. These hazards often go unnoticed but can cause significant long-term damage to hearing, skin, or overall health.  

### 3. Ergonomic Hazards  
Ergonomic hazards arise from poor workplace design or repetitive strain. Examples include improper workstation setup, frequent lifting, awkward or repetitive movements, poor posture, and vibration. Short-term exposure may cause soreness, while long-term exposure can lead to chronic musculoskeletal disorders.  

### 4. Chemical Hazards  
Chemicals in solid, liquid, or gas form can harm workers. Common examples include cleaning agents, paints, solvents, acids, gases like carbon monoxide or propane, fumes from welding, and flammable materials like gasoline. Even everyday chemicals may cause illness for sensitive workers, making proper labeling, ventilation, and protective equipment essential.  

### 5. Psychological Hazards  
Work-related stress and mental health risks are categorized as psychological hazards. These include bullying, harassment, workplace violence, fatigue, excessive workload, customer aggression, remote or isolated work, and frequent workplace changes. While good work contributes to mental well-being, poor conditions can negatively impact health and morale.  

### 6. Safety Hazards  
Safety hazards are the most common and include unsafe physical conditions such as spills, blocked aisles, cords on the floor, working from heights, unguarded machinery, electrical hazards, confined spaces, and malfunctioning equipment. Heavy machinery, missing machine guards, or improper lockout/tagout procedures also increase risks. These hazards can cause direct injuries and trigger secondary risks, such as damaged protective equipment leading to chemical exposure.

### Conclusion  
By recognizing these six categories of hazards—**biological, physical, ergonomic, chemical, psychological, and safety hazards**—employers and workers can work together to reduce risks. Conducting regular hazard assessments, implementing controls, and promptly reporting hazards to supervisors are critical steps in creating a safe and healthy workplace. Identifying hazards is the foundation of prevention, ensuring that accidents and illnesses are minimized while productivity and worker well-being are maintained.
