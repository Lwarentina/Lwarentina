# Intro to OSHA

The **Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)** is an agency under the U.S. Department of Labor, created through the **Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) of 1970**. Before OSHA existed, there were no national laws that specifically protected workers from safety and health hazards. Its mission is clear: **to save lives, prevent injuries, and protect the health of America’s workers** by ensuring safe and healthy workplace conditions.  

OSHA covers a wide range of industries, such as **manufacturing, construction, agriculture, medicine, longshoring, disaster relief**, and even religious organizations when they employ workers for non-religious purposes.  

To achieve its mission, OSHA:  
- Develops and enforces job safety and health standards.  
- Conducts worksite inspections.  
- Requires employers to maintain injury and illness records.  
- Provides training programs to improve knowledge of occupational safety and health.  
- Supports state-run occupational safety programs.  

### Employer Responsibilities  
Employers are legally obligated to provide a safe workplace. If no specific standards exist, they must still comply with the **General Duty Clause**, which requires workplaces to be free of recognized hazards. Employers must:  
- Establish safety policies and administrative controls.  
- Use **engineering controls** to reduce risks.  
- Provide **personal protective equipment (PPE)** when hazards cannot be fully eliminated.  
- Pay for most required PPE and train employees on its correct use.  
- Report fatalities within **8 hours** and serious incidents (hospitalization, amputation, or eye loss) within **24 hours**.  
- Keep accurate records of injuries and illnesses.  

### Worker Rights  
Workers have key rights under OSHA, including:  
- The right to a **safe and healthy workplace**.  
- The right to **know about workplace hazards and chemicals**.  
- The right to **training and information**.  
- The right to **access injury and illness records**.  
- The right to **file complaints** with OSHA and participate in inspections.  
- Protection against **retaliation** for reporting unsafe conditions.  

### OSHA Inspections  
Inspections are a major enforcement tool and follow four stages:  
1. Presenting credentials.  
2. Opening conference.  
3. Walk-around inspection.  
4. Closing conference.  

If violations are found, OSHA issues **citations and penalties** depending on the severity. Employers and workers both have rights to contest aspects of citations, though workers cannot dispute the penalties directly.  

### Resources  
Safety information can be accessed both inside and outside the workplace:  
- **Inside**: Labels, warning signs, Safety Data Sheets (SDSs), training manuals, and procedures.  
- **Outside**: OSHA’s official website (www.osha.gov), healthcare professionals, and libraries with safety and health resources.

### Conclusion  
OSHA plays a vital role in protecting workers across the United States by setting and enforcing standards, requiring employer compliance, and ensuring workers understand their rights. While OSHA provides regulations and oversight, achieving a truly safe workplace depends on **cooperation between employers and employees** in identifying and reducing hazards.
