# Intro to OSHA

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Labor created under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) of 1970. Before OSHA, there were no national laws protecting workers from safety and health hazards. Its mission is to save lives, prevent injuries, and protect the health of workers by ensuring safe and healthy workplace conditions. OSHA covers most industries, including manufacturing, construction, agriculture, medicine, disaster relief, and even religious organizations when they employ workers for non-religious purposes.  

OSHA enforces standards through inspections, record-keeping requirements, and training programs. Employers have the legal responsibility to provide a safe and healthy workplace. When no specific standards apply, they must follow the General Duty Clause, which requires the workplace to be free from recognized hazards that could cause death or serious harm. Employers are expected to implement administrative safety policies, use engineering controls, and, when necessary, provide personal protective equipment (PPE). Employers must also pay for most PPE and train employees on its proper use.  

Workers are granted significant rights under OSHA. These include the right to a safe and healthy workplace, access to information about workplace hazards and chemicals, the right to training, and the ability to view injury and illness records. Employees may also file complaints with OSHA, participate in inspections, and are legally protected against retaliation for reporting safety concerns. Employers must maintain accurate injury and illness logs, report workplace fatalities within 8 hours, and report serious incidents—such as hospitalizations, amputations, or loss of an eye—within 24 hours.  

Inspections are a vital part of OSHA’s enforcement system. They typically follow four stages: presenting credentials, an opening conference, a walk-around of the worksite, and a closing conference. If violations are found, citations are issued. Penalties vary based on the severity and type of violation. Both employers and employees have certain rights to contest or appeal parts of a citation.  

OSHA also emphasizes education and access to resources. Within the workplace, employees can rely on hazard labels, Safety Data Sheets (SDSs), manuals, and training materials. Outside resources include the OSHA website, healthcare professionals, and libraries for further information.  

In conclusion, OSHA plays a critical role in protecting America’s workforce by setting and enforcing standards while also empowering employees with rights and knowledge. However, true workplace safety depends on the cooperation of both employers and workers to identify hazards, maintain protections, and uphold safe working environments.
